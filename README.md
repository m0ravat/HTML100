# Semantic HTML
A way to make code more readable instead of layering everything under a div, alot also come with custom basic functionality/styling.  

Main skeleton structure:   
Navigation bar --> Header --> Main (--> Section --> Article) --> Footer (Address)

Meta head content: 
viewport - Automatically intiailised via html:5  
description - Brief description of site  
keywords - Buzzwords related to site's content  
author - Name/alias  

# Webpack 
A way of bundling CSS and JS into an optimized format for faster loading times. Also makes it unreadable so can't be stolen and
modified by someone else. Built into frameworks like React but holds use for basic plain HTML/CSS/JS websites.  

# ES6 
Special semantics for JS - Very useful to learn before moving onto frameworks as Express utilises () => {} as a way of 
running functions, confusing for people who don't know how it works. 

# CSS 

## Bulma 
Prebuilt CSS library for quick website themes and design. Requires use of SAAS to adjust theme colours, extensive features on
components and page layout based elements. 

Pros - Handles responsiveness well, very good hero section/navbar. Handles padding/centering well in forms and uses skeleton lines. 
Good pagination layout as well as modals & card setups made already. 

## Materialise
Prebuilt CSS library similar to Bulma.
